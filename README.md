# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to ascertain the feasibility of launching a bike-share company in Des Moines, Iowa. To perform this analysis, data from a similar ride-share company, Citi Bike (which operates in New York City), was used to create visualization in the data visulaization software Tableau. This analysis turns the raw ride, trip, and customer data into interactive and easy-to-digest graphs that can be presented to stakeholders who lack the background or skills to parse the data themsleves.
# Results
- The following visualizations show the frequency, duration, and distribution of trip data from Citi Bike NYC:
